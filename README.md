# To-Do App Project Created With React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my first complete build and it is a basic To-Do list app created using the ReactJS tutorial.

The app uses Bootstrap CSS and JS components.

## Appendix

The `My components` folder in the `src` folder contains the following components:

### `About.js`

JavaScript component for the about page.

### `AddToDo.js`

Adds the functionality to add items to the To-Do list through a form.

### `Footer.js`

Footer element for the app.

### `Header.js`

Header element for the app.

### `ToDo.js`

Defines the To-Do list section in the app.

### `ToDoElem.js`

Defines functionality to display each element of the list.

### `ModalAlert.js`

Shows button to display modal alert when the list is empty.
This has to be changed to not display the button and directly display the modal.

### `fontawesome.js`

Library created for icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
